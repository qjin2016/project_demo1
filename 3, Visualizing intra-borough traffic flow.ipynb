    "The visualization used chord diagram (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_diagram) to represent the inter-/intra-borough traffic. There is a circular slider bar at the top left corner, which represents a clock with 24 hours. The user can drag the round slider to explore the traffic flow as time progresses during a day. The center of the circular slider bar shows text to indicate the hour of the day. Some of the code for implementing this visualization was borrowed from http://projects.delimited.io/experiments/chord-diagrams/hair.html\n",

    "This visualization tool provides an interactive and qualitative overview of both inter- and intra-borough green cab traffic flow in New York City and would help users better understand the dynamic of green cab customers travelling behavior. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "It's easy to find out that most of the trips happened in Manhattan, Bronx and Queens. Manhattan had the largest number of trips compared with other areas. Intra-borough traffic was the predominant traffic flow in all of these three boroughs. \n",
    "\n",
    "At 4:00 a.m., the traffic flow shifted. Trips at the Bronx area increased a lot and became as busy as the Manhattan area while trips at the Queens area decreased:\n",

    "<img src = './development_process/a-2.png' height=\"400\" width=\"500\">\n",
